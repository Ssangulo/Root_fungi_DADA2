# Root_fungi_DADA2
This repository contains scripts to process Illumina ITS2 reads from Gaultheria myrsinoides roots in 4 Colombian p√°ramo sites. The workflow includes read concatenation, demultiplexing, adapter/primer trimming, quality filtering and denoising with DADA2, chimera removal, LULU curation, subtraction of OTUs from controls, replicate filtering, and taxonomic assignment with the UNITE database. Final outputs are curated OTU/ASV tables and phyloseq objects for downstream ecological analysis.
